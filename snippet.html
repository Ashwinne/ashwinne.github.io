					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/book2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<h4>Sampled from Ch. XIX</h4>
					<p>"Ugh," Rae grimaced, disgust plain on her features. "I don't give a rat's longtailed ass about your creepy stories of inbred magic freaks, what I care about is why you <i>did this to me!</i>"</p>

<p>"Because you're my firstborn," August replied dismissively, as if stating the obvious. "My heir. We live out our lives, we take and we give, and the next generation inherits all that remains. A vast family tree means nothing. There are families older than ours, far weaker, cursed by idiot magi marrying for idiotic reasons, wasting their life languishing on the shoulders of giants, spending far more than they can borrow and folding once their debts come due. A more dire affliction than your new companion, hm?"</p>

<p><i>Stupid relatives, or a life spent hellbound and awaiting an eternity of damnation? That one's pretty tough,</i> she didn't retort, glaring daggers at her father with laser-hot intensity. <i>I'll need time to chew that one over.</i></p>

<p>"All of it, the lineage of magi, the principles of succession, our family grimoire... in the end, everything comes down to the passing of the torch. And sweetheart," August said, teeth gleaming in the magelight, "I busted my ass to make sure the torch I passed onto you was a beacon, brighter than the whitest flames of my funeral pyre."</p>

<p>"It is the <i>cruelest of ironies</i>," he sighed, "that your brain is not."</p>
