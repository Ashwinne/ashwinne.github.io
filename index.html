					<p>Set in modern-day New England with a touch of the arcane, <i>The Grimoire's Heir</i> is an urban fantasy coming-of-age novel following Raven Anne Fairclough, a sixteen-year-old magus, as she explores and confronts the connections that bind her to others; connections such as those of heritage and familial ties, blossoming romance, and an inescapable demonic contract shackling her immortal soul to inevitable damnation.</p>
					<p>The eldest daughter and scion of a generations-old magical lineage, Rae finds herself contacted for the first time in years by her estranged and abusive recluse of a father, August Fairclough. The dying man confronts her with the matter of inheritance of his grimoire, a summation of the magical knowledge built upon by generation after generation of her ancestors â€“ and introduces her to Belfnir, the underworldly custodian of the curse that has afflicted the Fairclough line for centuries, preying on firstborn to firstborn.</p>
					<p>Confronted with the prospect of being bound to a timeless demon upon her father's death, Rae frantically searches for a way to break the curse, and in doing so, secures the acquaintance and assistance of the wry and blithely charming Cassius Vale, a young man with ties and troubles all of his own.  Together, they grow closer as they race against the ticking clock of August's dwindling lifespan in pursuit of a solution, turning to ancient magic texts, unearthly (and uncannily bitchy) fae, two A.M. burger runs, and the Society of Spirit, a cabal of ragtag young magi led by the eccentric Cornelia Peters. </P>
						<p>As Rae attempts to defy her fate with Cassius at her side, she uncovers answers to questions haunting her since childhood, piecing together the puzzle surrounding the history of Belfnir's curse and her enigmatic family legacy. Throwing herself in the unraveling mystery, Rae loses sight of the other connections in her life, failing to notice the bonds and fetters lurking behind Cassius's grin and Cornelia's kindness as they threaten to ensnare her with their own agendas.
</p>

<p>What brings us closer to friends, families, and lovers? What drives us apart? <i>The Grimoire's Heir</I> is driven by a narrative that emphasizes how our changing relationships and ties with one another shape us into who we are as we grow, each connection tugging in its own direction. These mundane concepts are explored through the fantastical lens of magical heritage and arcane contracts, in a setting shaped by hierarchies where lineage and birthright are everything, and where the sins of the father are borne by the son, burdening each new generation with an ever-increasing weight.</p>
